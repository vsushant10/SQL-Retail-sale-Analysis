# SQL-Retail-sale-Analysis
This project is demonstrated SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is my first github project and ideal for the starting the journey in data analysis SQL.
